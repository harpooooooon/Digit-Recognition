 A Neural Network designed to read handrwitten numbers


The Neural Network implement the stochastic gradient descent learning algorithm for a feedforward neural network. Gradients are 
calculated using backpropagation and with the sigmoid neurons defines as 1.0/(1.0+np.exp(-z)). Note that I have focused on making the code simple, easily readable, and easily modifiable. It is not optimized in any manner regarding performance.
